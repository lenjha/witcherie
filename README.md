## Submission Content Ideas
* Link to a GitHub repository containing an app started to learn something new
* Scores on TreeHouse or HackerRank - or other challenges/exercises/work comleted on an external site
* Accounts started following on LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, etc. that provide perspective/inspiration
* A Trello board
* A blog/vlog you've started someplace
* A blog/article/PDF/Reddit thread containing some valuable information to you and will help you improve
* Photo or drawing of a database schema, or plan for an app, product, process, etc.
* Website screenshots you've found

## Notes
* Consider Pomodoro Technique
  * 25 minutes working followed with a 5-minute break
    * At the fourth break, take a longer break (20-30 minutes is good)
  * There are Pomodoro Clocks for sale that look cute
* Maybe sign up for a website to practice problems (like HackerRank) and add a screenshot of your work to your project or drawing of your solution and whatnot?
* UI/frontend improvement?
* Research libraries
* Make a programming Twitter
