# ~~ Witcherie ~~

#### Project by Lena Ha

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.

### Project Requirements
* Details on how time was spent and what was accomplished, and where you stopped
* Which questions regarding issues (both technical and non-technical) that need further work for career-preparation
* What work ought to be prioritized in preparation for the weeks to come (and for post-Epicodus)
* Proof of working on answering the above questions
* Use JavaScript-related technology

### Numbers

|  Time  |        Action      |     Notes    |
|--------|--------------------|--------------|
|  8:00  | Reading/Reflection |  The README was built during this time to catalogue thoughts and progress. |
|  8:51  | README.md has essentials laid out, some reflection-time  |  Markdown language tricks were researched |
|  9:05  | Write out a couple weaknesses and strengths, looked up some Pomodoro timers but was disappointed  |   |
|  9:19  | Plot out Witcherie site, read up on SQL  |   |

### Strengths
* Typing speed - consistently above 70 wpm (usually around 85-ish?)

### Weaknesses
* Data-flow
  * parent-child relationships
  * keeping track of setting/calling variables
* Vocalizing thought processes and explaining code
* Sometimes takes a little too long to process thoughts...

### Submission Content Ideas
* Link to a GitHub repository containing an app started to learn something new
* Scores on TreeHouse or HackerRank - or other challenges/exercises/work completed on an external site
* Accounts started following on LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, etc. that provide perspective/inspiration
* A Trello board
* A blog/vlog you've started someplace
* A blog/article/PDF/Reddit thread containing some valuable information to you and will help you improve
* Photo or drawing of a database schema, or plan for an app, product, process, etc.
* Website screenshots you've found

### Notes
* Consider Pomodoro Technique
  * 25 minutes working followed with a 5-minute break
    * At the fourth break, take a longer break (20-30 minutes is good)
* Maybe sign up for a website to practice problems (like HackerRank) and add a screenshot of your work to your project or drawing of your solution and whatnot?
* UI/front-end improvement?
* Research libraries
* Make a programming Twitter
